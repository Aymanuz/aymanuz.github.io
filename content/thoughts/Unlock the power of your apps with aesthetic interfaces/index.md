As much as I love to rename and keep my layers in Figma organized, it’s not always the easiest to do, mainly because renaming can be such a tedious task. To help, Figma has a built-in feature that allows any number of selected layers to be simultaneously renamed, and it’s a powerful utility that can dramatically speed up the naming process.

To access this bulk rename menu, all that’s needed is to select the layers you’d like to adjust, and then either right-click on your selection and click “Rename,” or you can tap ⌘ + R, if using a Mac, or Ctrl + R, if on Windows. Within the dialog that appears, Figma provides several helpful options, such as adding a prefix or suffix, renaming all layers to an exact string, or finding and replacing parts of a layer’s name using the Match field. Next time you need to rename multiple layers at once, give this feature a try!

A few years ago, Figma announced a feature called Selection Colors, which allows designers to select any number of objects on the canvas and adjust the various color values. If you haven’t tried this yet, it’s such a wonderful and brilliant feature, but sometimes you may need to select and bulk-adjust properties that aren’t always related to color. Unless components and instances are used throughout the entire file, this can take some serious time.

To help with this, Figma provides users with the option to use several selection queries that can be accessed from the quick actions search bar (⌘ + / on Mac, Ctrl + / on Windows) whenever objects are selected on the canvas. All available selection options appear by opening the menu and typing “Select…”. For example, I recently had a situation where I wasn’t using components (gasp!), and I needed to adjust all size 12 text within a design from a medium font weight to a heavier font weight. Because this option existed, I only needed to open up the quick actions bar and type in “select all with same text properties.” Figma automatically selected every text layer that matched, and I could adjust the font weight for over 100 layers in just a few seconds. It felt like magic.

Tip #3: Spacebar’s Superpower
If you've ever found yourself frustrated with how objects mistakenly enter or exit a frame when dragging them around on the canvas (this can often happen when Auto Layout is used), this tip may help! When moving an object, it's possible to ignore each of the frames it passes over or outside by pressing the spacebar immediately after dragging. It's a simple tip, but this one has helped me so much throughout my daily work of moving those rectangles around.

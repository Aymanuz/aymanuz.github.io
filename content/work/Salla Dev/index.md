###### About Salla & Salla Dev
Salla is the largest Saudi e-commerce platform in the Middle East that empowers you to initiate, manage, and expand your own entrepreneurial venture, equipped with comprehensive support and advanced functionalities essential for achieving success in your business journey.

Salla Partners is a program for developers who want to build apps and themes for the Salla e-commerce platform. Along with Salla Partners, the Salla Developer Portal is a website that provides developers with the resources they need to build apps and themes. The portal includes documentation on the Salla APIs, code samples, tutorials, and a community forum where developers can collaborate and ask questions.

## My Role
When I worked with Salla at first, I was only hired as a freelancer to build Salla Developer Portal. Yet then I ended up hired with a full time position to build also Salla Partners and Salla App Store.

I collaborated with an amazing project manager, CTO and an additional lead designer to explore insights and transform ideas into functionalities that cater to customer behaviors and motivations. I developed frameworks and prototypes to communicate the vision, design principles, and content strategy, which played a crucial role in promoting concepts, achieving consensus, and influencing decision-making. I also crafted and presented designs to secure approval from executives, senior stakeholders, and various other teams within Salla at different stages of the project.

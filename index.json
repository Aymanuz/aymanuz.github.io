[{"content":" Flexible organization with tags # Instead of rigid folders, Bear uses tags to organize notes. Just like social media, a tag is a simple pound sign and a word, like #bear, and they can go anywhere in your notes. Bear\u0026rsquo;s Sidebar will collect your tags, and you can click a tag to instantly see all notes that contain it.\nOne of the many benefits of tags is that a note can exist in multiple tags at once. For example, a note with a todo list for shopping and groceries could have the tags #errands, #groceries, and #shopping, then appear when you click any of those tags.\n👉 Get granular with multiple words # Bear supports multi-word tags like #welcome notes# and #my next novel# and #world domination#. They allow for more specific organization and are just plain easier to read. As you can see, to create a multi-word tag, simply wrap the first and final words in pound signs.\n👉 Add depth with nested tags # Like folders, you can also create sub-tags which we call nested tags. These are great for organizing multiple projects under a main work or school tag, or multiple days under multiple months of your journaling notes.\nTo nest one tag under another, use a forward slash between words, like: #bear/welcome. In the Sidebar, a folding button appears next to the top-level tag which reveals its nested tags.\nFind that needle in a haystack # Bear has fast, powerful search that can even find text in photos and PDFs (Bear Pro required). Simply click the magnifier at the top of the Note List (or use ⌘ + ⇧ + F) and start typing.\nBut there’s so much more to search in Bear.\n👉 Smart Search # Like most search engines, Bear supports a variety of search operators to filter your results. For example, you can search for a specific phrase by “surrounding it in quotes”, exclude keywords by adding a minus symbol (-) before them, and more. Learn about Bear search operators.\n👉 Special Search # These are search triggers that look for specific types of data in your notes. For example, @todo finds notes containing unfinished tasks, and @images finds notes that have photos. Learn about Special Search in Bear\u0026rsquo;s online documentation.\n👉 In-note search # Bear can search all text in a note, including text in photos and PDFs (Bear Pro required). While editing a note, use the three dots (⋮) menu and select Search, then start typing.\nBear will highlight all results in the note. Use the arrows to navigate results, and click the magnifying glass for a Find \u0026amp; Replace tool.\nBear Your Way # We do our best work in the right environment, and we recognize that space is different for everyone. Bear has some useful options to make it your own.\n👉 Themes # The right theme for your notes and writing can turn a slog of a project into a breeze. Check out Bear’s theme collection in settings, including even more options unlocked with Bear Pro.\n👉 Editor formatting # Prefer to write double-spaced? Are your paragraphs too narrow or close together? Check out the Typography section in settings to dial in your typography just right, including choosing a different font.\n👉 Note List view options # The Note List offers a useful preview of your notes—their contents, photos, and attachments. But if you don’t want attachments to be previewed, or you’d rather see smaller previews and more notes at once, click the Note List heading for options to control these and other features.\nLearn more about Bear 📚 # [[Get started with Bear]] [[Work faster and easier with Bear]] #bear/welcome\n","date":"11 Jun 2023","permalink":"/thoughts/organize-search-and-customize-in-bear/","section":"Thoughts","summary":"Flexible organization with tags # Instead of rigid folders, Bear uses tags to organize notes.

To help, Figma has a built-in feature that allows any number of selected layers to be simultaneously renamed, and it’s a powerful utility that can dramatically speed up the naming process.\nTo access this bulk rename menu, all that’s needed is to select the layers you’d like to adjust, and then either right-click on your selection and click “Rename,” or you can tap ⌘ + R, if using a Mac, or Ctrl + R, if on Windows. Within the dialog that appears, Figma provides several helpful options, such as adding a prefix or suffix, renaming all layers to an exact string, or finding and replacing parts of a layer’s name using the Match field. Next time you need to rename multiple layers at once, give this feature a try!\nA few years ago, Figma announced a feature called Selection Colors, which allows designers to select any number of objects on the canvas and adjust the various color values. If you haven’t tried this yet, it’s such a wonderful and brilliant feature, but sometimes you may need to select and bulk-adjust properties that aren’t always related to color. Unless components and instances are used throughout the entire file, this can take some serious time.\nTo help with this, Figma provides users with the option to use several selection queries that can be accessed from the quick actions search bar (⌘ + / on Mac, Ctrl + / on Windows) whenever objects are selected on the canvas. All available selection options appear by opening the menu and typing “Select…”. For example, I recently had a situation where I wasn’t using components (gasp!), and I needed to adjust all size 12 text within a design from a medium font weight to a heavier font weight. Because this option existed, I only needed to open up the quick actions bar and type in “select all with same text properties.” Figma automatically selected every text layer that matched, and I could adjust the font weight for over 100 layers in just a few seconds. It felt like magic.\nTip #3: Spacebar’s Superpower If you\u0026rsquo;ve ever found yourself frustrated with how objects mistakenly enter or exit a frame when dragging them around on the canvas (this can often happen when Auto Layout is used), this tip may help! When moving an object, it\u0026rsquo;s possible to ignore each of the frames it passes over or outside by pressing the spacebar immediately after dragging. It\u0026rsquo;s a simple tip, but this one has helped me so much throughout my daily work of moving those rectangles around.\n","date":"5 Nov 2022","permalink":"/thoughts/unlock-the-power-of-your-apps-with-aesthetic-interfaces/","section":"Thoughts","summary":"As much as I love to rename and keep my layers in Figma organized, it’s not always the easiest to do, mainly because renaming can be such a tedious task.

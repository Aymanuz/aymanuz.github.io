It offers a unified console to help desk agents and IT managers, enabling them to efficiently monitor and maintain the assets and IT requests generated by users within an organization\u0026rsquo;s IT resources.\nMy Role # I collaborated closely with the PMs to create visual designs, user flows, A/B testing of potential solutions, and prototypes. Additionally, I actively participated in user testing and research. Working in tandem with the front-end developers, I ensured that quality and interactions were thoroughly addressed throughout the entire process, starting from the initial concept all the way to the final implementation.\nDesign Process # Product discovery and research were key. At first, I didn’t realise how big the scope of the project was, the methods that cleared that up were product analytics and competitor analysis, and they were the best for continuous product discovery. Tons of features, diagrams and docs had to be written before even considering initial ideation.\nA lot of sketches, wireframes and diagrams were made. Giving the scope of the project, we had many of “oh, ahaaa! And I don’t understand.” moments.\nDesign Tools # Since I was the only designer at the time, it seemed only logical to adopt a design system instead of building one from scratch at that time - Orbit Design System by Kiwi was my choice. I was already handed a couple of tasks and main features to do before even considering a culture or guidelines to follow while designing. I knew if I didn’t follow one myself, I would be wasting a lot of time, and things would definitely get messy.\nBring it all together. # One powerful point the system has is its customization. Each user may get their own unique interface. Each user may have different permissions for what they can do or see in a single screen. That challenge opened up a door for even more research and customized UI.\nAbove, the Form Builder was one of the most powerful features I built that unlucked more space for users to making forms in any way they need. It helpled in two key aspects that are: Efficient Data Collection: Form builders enable organizations to create customized digital forms that can be easily shared with users or customers. This streamlines the process of gathering accurate and structured data, eliminating the need for manual entry and reducing the chances of errors.\nProcess Automation: This allows for the automation of repetitive tasks and processes triggered by form submissions, reducing manual intervention and improving efficiency.\nBuilding a data-focused dashboard, dashboards* # Yaquoti dashboard is a comprehensive and user-friendly that offers a range of solutions aimed at enhancing organizational efficiency and productivity. Through its intuitive interface, the dashboard provides real-time insights and management capabilities across various domains. With features like performance monitoring, requests tracking, Yaquoti empowers businesses to streamline their processes, identify bottlenecks, and proactively address issues. The dashboard\u0026rsquo;s solutions span IT service management, employee management, and more, making it an indispensable tool for businesses seeking to optimize their operations and ensure a seamless and secure digital environment.\n","date":"11 Jun 2023","permalink":"/work/yaquoti-workflow/","section":"Works","summary":"Yaquoti Workflow is an all-inclusive software designed for managing help desk operations and asset management.

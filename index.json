It offers a unified console to help desk agents and IT managers, enabling them to efficiently monitor and maintain the assets and IT requests generated by users within an organization\u0026rsquo;s IT resources.\nMy Role # I collaborated closely with the PMs to create visual designs, user flows, A/B testing of potential solutions, and prototypes. Additionally, I actively participated in user testing and research. Working in tandem with the front-end developers, I ensured that quality and interactions were thoroughly addressed throughout the entire process, starting from the initial concept all the way to the final implementation.\nDesign Process # Product discovery and research were key. At first, I didn’t realize how big the scope of the project was, the methods that cleared that up were product analytics and competitor analysis, and they were the best for continuous product discovery. Tons of features, diagrams and docs had to be written before even considering initial ideation.\nA lot of sketches, wireframes and diagrams were made. Givin the scope of the project, we had many “oh, ahaaa! And I don’t understand.” moments.\nDesign Tools # Since I was the only designer at the time, it seemed only logical to adopt a design system instead of building one from scratch at that time - Orbit Design System by Kiwi was my choice. I was already handed a couple of tasks and main features to do before even considering a culture or guidelines to follow while designing. I knew if I didn’t follow one myself, I would be wasting a lot of time, and things would get messy.\nBring it all together. # One powerful point the system has is its customization. Each user may get their unique interface. Each user may have different permissions for what they can do or see on a single screen. That challenge opened up a door for even more research and customized UI.\nAbove, the Form Builder was one of the most powerful features I built that unlocked more space for users to make forms in any way they need. It helped in two key aspects that are: Efficient Data Collection: Form builders enable organizations to create customized digital forms that can be easily shared with users or customers. This streamlines the process of gathering accurate and structured data, eliminating the need for manual entry and reducing the chances of errors.\nProcess Automation: This allows for the automation of repetitive tasks and processes triggered by form submissions, reducing manual intervention and improving efficiency.\nBuilding a data-focused dashboard, dashboards* # Yaquoti dashboard is comprehensive and user-friendly and offers a range of solutions aimed at enhancing organizational efficiency and productivity. Through its intuitive interface, the dashboard provides real-time insights and management capabilities across various domains. With features like performance monitoring, request tracking, Yaquoti empowers businesses to streamline their processes, identify bottlenecks, and proactively address issues. The dashboard\u0026rsquo;s solutions span IT service management, employee management, and more, making it an indispensable tool for businesses seeking to optimize their operations and ensure a seamless and secure digital environment.\n","date":"11 Jun 2023","permalink":"/work/yaquoti-workflow/","section":"Work","summary":"Yaquoti Workflow is an all-inclusive software designed for managing help desk operations and asset management.

I wrote my first line of code back in 2013. At that time, I had no idea what UX design was until 2017 when I worked for a startup that created a streaming platform. A friend of mine handed me a book about UX design. It was poorly translated to Arabic from English, but that poorly translated book was the beginning of something I had never thought of.\nIn 2017, I enrolled in college to study Information Systems, however after a year, I couldn’t see the added value of college, so I dropped choosing to focus on my career and continue what I have started with the experience that already had built. I believe by the time you read this, I already have over six years of experience in the field, had a couple of positions in respectful companies, worked on tons of different kinds of projects, and still probably work for a lead hardware company called Ubiquiti.\nYou can see my ex-lives here in my CV.\nHere's where I spend most of my day. I’m based in Sweden now, living with my lovely wife and daughter, and sure still exploring this land with its endless probabilities. There are some feelings you can\u0026rsquo;t describe, but you can show. Here are some of those:\n","date":"5 Nov 2022","permalink":"/about/","section":"About","summary":"Hi, I’m Ayman.\nI came to design from a background in Web Development.

It offers a unified console to help desk agents and IT managers, enabling them to efficiently monitor and maintain the assets and IT requests generated by users within an organization\u0026rsquo;s IT resources.\nMy Role # I collaborated closely with the PMs to create visual designs, user flows, A/B testing of potential solutions, and prototypes. Additionally, I actively participated in user testing and research. Working in tandem with the front-end developers, I ensured that quality and interactions were thoroughly addressed throughout the entire process, starting from the initial concept all the way to the final implementation.\nDesign Process # Product discovery and research were key. At first, I didn’t realise how big the scope of the project was, the methods that cleared that up were product analytics and competitor analysis, and they were the best for continuous product discovery. Tons of features, diagrams and docs had to be written before even considering initial ideation.\nA lot of sketches, wireframes and diagrams were made. Giving the scope of the project, we had many of “oh, ahaaa! And I don’t understand.” moments.\nDesign Tools # Since I was the only designer at the time, it seemed only logical to adopt a design system instead of building one from scratch at that time - Orbit Design System by Kiwi was my choice. I was already handed a couple of tasks and main features to do before even considering a culture or guidelines to follow while designing. I knew if I didn’t follow one myself, I would be wasting a lot of time, and things would definitely get messy.\nBring it all together. # One powerful point the system has is its customization. Each user may get their own unique interface. Each user may have different permissions for what they can do or see in a single screen. That challenge opened up a door for even more research and customized UI.\nAbove, the Form Builder was one of the most powerful features I built that unlucked more space for users to making forms in any way they need. It helpled in two key aspects that are: Efficient Data Collection: Form builders enable organizations to create customized digital forms that can be easily shared with users or customers. This streamlines the process of gathering accurate and structured data, eliminating the need for manual entry and reducing the chances of errors.\nProcess Automation: This allows for the automation of repetitive tasks and processes triggered by form submissions, reducing manual intervention and improving efficiency.\nBuilding a data-focused dashboard, dashboards* # Yaquoti dashboard is a comprehensive and user-friendly that offers a range of solutions aimed at enhancing organizational efficiency and productivity. Through its intuitive interface, the dashboard provides real-time insights and management capabilities across various domains. With features like performance monitoring, requests tracking, Yaquoti empowers businesses to streamline their processes, identify bottlenecks, and proactively address issues. The dashboard\u0026rsquo;s solutions span IT service management, employee management, and more, making it an indispensable tool for businesses seeking to optimize their operations and ensure a seamless and secure digital environment.\n","date":"11 Jun 2023","permalink":"/work/yaquoti-workflow/","section":"Works","summary":"Yaquoti Workflow is an all-inclusive software designed for managing help desk operations and asset management.

To help, Figma has a built-in feature that allows any number of selected layers to be simultaneously renamed, and it’s a powerful utility that can dramatically speed up the naming process.\nTo access this bulk rename menu, all that’s needed is to select the layers you’d like to adjust, and then either right-click on your selection and click “Rename,” or you can tap ⌘ + R, if using a Mac, or Ctrl + R, if on Windows. Within the dialog that appears, Figma provides several helpful options, such as adding a prefix or suffix, renaming all layers to an exact string, or finding and replacing parts of a layer’s name using the Match field. Next time you need to rename multiple layers at once, give this feature a try!\nA few years ago, Figma announced a feature called Selection Colors, which allows designers to select any number of objects on the canvas and adjust the various color values. If you haven’t tried this yet, it’s such a wonderful and brilliant feature, but sometimes you may need to select and bulk-adjust properties that aren’t always related to color. Unless components and instances are used throughout the entire file, this can take some serious time.\nTo help with this, Figma provides users with the option to use several selection queries that can be accessed from the quick actions search bar (⌘ + / on Mac, Ctrl + / on Windows) whenever objects are selected on the canvas. All available selection options appear by opening the menu and typing “Select…”. For example, I recently had a situation where I wasn’t using components (gasp!), and I needed to adjust all size 12 text within a design from a medium font weight to a heavier font weight. Because this option existed, I only needed to open up the quick actions bar and type in “select all with same text properties.” Figma automatically selected every text layer that matched, and I could adjust the font weight for over 100 layers in just a few seconds. It felt like magic.\nTip #3: Spacebar’s Superpower If you\u0026rsquo;ve ever found yourself frustrated with how objects mistakenly enter or exit a frame when dragging them around on the canvas (this can often happen when Auto Layout is used), this tip may help! When moving an object, it\u0026rsquo;s possible to ignore each of the frames it passes over or outside by pressing the spacebar immediately after dragging. It\u0026rsquo;s a simple tip, but this one has helped me so much throughout my daily work of moving those rectangles around.\n","date":"5 Nov 2022","permalink":"/work/unlock-the-power-of-your-apps-with-aesthetic-interfaces/","section":"Works","summary":"As much as I love to rename and keep my layers in Figma organized, it’s not always the easiest to do, mainly because renaming can be such a tedious task.

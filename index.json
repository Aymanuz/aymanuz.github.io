The portal includes documentation on the Salla APIs, code samples, tutorials, and a community forum where developers can collaborate and ask questions.\nMy Role # When I worked with Salla at first, I was only hired as a freelancer to build the Salla Developer Portal. Yet then, I ended up hired with a full-time position to design Salla Partners, Salla Developer Portal, and Salla App Store.\nI collaborated with an amazing project manager, CTO and an additional lead designer to explore insights and transform ideas into functionalities that cater to customer behaviors and motivations. I developed frameworks and prototypes to communicate the vision and design principles, which played a crucial role in promoting concepts, achieving consensus, and influencing decision-making. I also crafted and presented designs to secure approval from executives, senior stakeholders, and various other teams within Salla at different stages of the project.\nTHE CHALLENGE\nMake a deeper connection with customers developers The growing e-commerce market is creating a lot of opportunities for developers. They are in high demand to build and maintain e-commerce websites, applications as well as themes. Developers are also needed to develop new features and functionality for e-commerce platforms.\nSo, our challenge was to create the perfect environment that developers need for designing, developing, and maintaining e-commerce apps and themes to be successful in the growing e-commerce market.\nDesign Process # To expedite market entry, we were assigned the task of designing and constructing Salla Partners within the pre-existing E-Commerce development environment. This approach was seen as advantageous and the least risky option. This initial architectural decision significantly influenced our ability to deliver a high-quality customer experience.\nMy research phase involved seeking inspiration, examining design and interaction trends, reviewing competitors, and asking questions to gain insights about the industry as much as I could. It\u0026rsquo;s a swift and effective process.\nThe confluence of a set launch date and ambitious project scope created a demanding environment fraught with coordination and timing obstacles. The combination of a set launch date and an expansive scope resulted in a challenging and time-sensitive atmosphere.\nVisual Design # Just because engineers will use it mostly, doesn’t mean it has to be mundane. Consequently, developing a contemporary and distinctive visual style became a top priority. This entailed refining cards, fundamental UI elements and essential components, all of which were heavily reliant on the design systems I established. The quality of the user interface played a pivotal role in the platform.\nThis project presented a chance to experiment with interactions and animations, as well as develop reusable components to maintain consistency.\nSome enhancements during the building had to be made.\nAs commonly known in such services, the process of publishing an app was a bit long due to the amount of information and requirements, and that had to be considered. So we had to segregate those requirements into tiny steps so the users don’t feel overwhelmed filling out the whole application.\nWhat merchants see # A lot of work was poured to make the Salla App Store as accessible and humanly useable as possible. To provide merchants with the best solution there is, and seek stakeholders\u0026rsquo; approval, A/B tests were conducted, and many rounds of iteration had to be taken.\nDifferent scenarios were covered, and a lot of questions had to be asked. For example, not all merchants have the experience to choose what apps are best for their stores, so we provided them with different kits they can pick from.\nWhat now? # When I look now to what Salla Partners has become, I feel really amazed! Hundreds of apps have been published to the store, and developers are building and publishing themes all over the platform. The platform has expanded impeccably, meeting the business requirements and users needs without a doubt.\n","date":"13 Sep 2023","permalink":"/work/salla-dev/","section":"Work","summary":"About Salla \u0026amp; Salla Dev # Salla is the largest Saudi e-commerce platform in the Middle East that empowers developers to initiate, manage, and expand their entrepreneurial venture, equipped with comprehensive support and advanced functionalities essential for achieving success in their business journey.","title":"Salla Partners \u0026 Developer Portals"},{"content":"","date":"13 Sep 2023","permalink":"/work/","section":"Work","summary":"","title":"Work"},{"content":"Arageek is one of the first Arabic online magazines to offer engaging and relevant content focused on technology and social media news to Arab youth. It covers a wide range of topics, including Technology news and reviews, Social media trends, Gaming, Science and education, Entrepreneurship and more.\nIt is known for its high-quality writing and its ability to make complex topics accessible to a wide audience. It has a loyal readership of millions of people across the Arab world. In addition to its website, Arageek also has a strong presence on social media, with over 3 million followers on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.\nIn 2023, Arageek is still one of the most popular and influential digital media websites in the Arab world. It continues to provide its readers with engaging and informative content on the latest trends and also produces a weekly podcast and several video series.\nGoals \u0026amp; Challenges # The reasons for doing a whole redesign were the following:\nIncrease user engagement with the content Faster performance Better Ads engagement Better Aesthetics Yet the biggest challenge was how to use a single web application (React on NextJS) to give users a native browsing experience, especially on mobile.\nDesign Process # First, we initiated a breakdown for the Website. We defined every page, section and widget that needed to be added, removed or enhanced to make a better experience for the readers and meet their expectations.\nInitial Ideas \u0026amp; Wireframes # In this project, I got wild with exploring the ideas that we can use. I threw sketches and initial interactions here and there to see what could stick. I attempted to investigate the potential structure and layout of certain views, acknowledging that the final order and positioning of elements had not been determined.\nImproving Architecture # A pain point that required immediate attention was the complex navigation structure, characterized by an abundance of categories and sub-categories within a single location. This intricacy hindered seamless navigation across various pages, resulting in decreased user engagement with the content. Recognizing the need for improvement and the introduction of new pages, we seized the opportunity to comprehensively restructure the navigation system. Our approach involved prioritizing the most frequently visited categories, streamlining the user experience by focusing on the most essential elements.\nEvolution # As Arageek marked a departure from conventional magazine design, it provided a strategic opening to introduce innovative design patterns, including depth, animation, and enhanced accessibility features. The intent was to gradually implement these design elements across the entirety of the website, paving the way for a more modern and cohesive user experience.\nBring It All Together # Given that a significant majority of our users access articles via mobile devices, prioritizing mobile optimization was imperative. During our analysis, it became evident that a limited selection of one or two article layouts for browsing appeared to be somewhat monotonous. Consequently, we have developed a variety of modular components tailored for diverse sections to enhance the user experience.\nGiven that advertising serves as the primary source of revenue for Arageek, we recognized an opportunity to exercise greater control and decision-making over their placement, timing, and presentation, rather than merely embedding them into the design post facto.\n","date":"12 Sep 2023","permalink":"/work/arageek/","section":"Work","summary":"Arageek is one of the first Arabic online magazines to offer engaging and relevant content focused on technology and social media news to Arab youth.

It offers a unified console to help desk agents and IT managers, enabling them to efficiently monitor and maintain the assets and IT requests generated by users within an organization\u0026rsquo;s IT resources.\nMy Role # I collaborated closely with the PMs to create visual designs, user flows, A/B testing of potential solutions, and prototypes. Additionally, I actively participated in user testing and research. Working in tandem with the front-end developers, I ensured that quality and interactions were thoroughly addressed throughout the entire process, starting from the initial concept all the way to the final implementation.\nDesign Process # Product discovery and research were key. At first, I didn’t realize how big the scope of the project was, the methods that cleared that up were product analytics and competitor analysis, and they were the best for continuous product discovery. Tons of features, diagrams and docs had to be written before even considering initial ideation.\nA lot of sketches, wireframes and diagrams were made. Givin the scope of the project, we had many “oh, ahaaa! And I don’t understand.” moments.\nDesign Tools # Since I was the only designer at the time, it seemed only logical to adopt a design system instead of building one from scratch at that time - Orbit Design System by Kiwi was my choice. I was already handed a couple of tasks and main features to do before even considering a culture or guidelines to follow while designing. I knew if I didn’t follow one myself, I would be wasting a lot of time, and things would get messy.\nBring it all together. # One powerful point the system has is its customization. Each user may get their unique interface. Each user may have different permissions for what they can do or see on a single screen. That challenge opened up a door for even more research and customized UI.\nAbove, the Form Builder was one of the most powerful features I built that unlocked more space for users to make forms in any way they need. It helped in two key aspects that are: Efficient Data Collection: Form builders enable organizations to create customized digital forms that can be easily shared with users or customers. This streamlines the process of gathering accurate and structured data, eliminating the need for manual entry and reducing the chances of errors.\nProcess Automation: This allows for the automation of repetitive tasks and processes triggered by form submissions, reducing manual intervention and improving efficiency.\nEach request has its process of actions, conversations and decisions, and it\u0026rsquo;s all stored.\nAlso, every request can have a different set of actions that a user can pre-select, and I had to cover all possible cases.\nBuilding a data-focused dashboard, dashboards* # Yaquoti dashboard is comprehensive and user-friendly and offers a range of solutions aimed at enhancing organizational efficiency and productivity. Through its intuitive interface, the dashboard provides real-time insights and management capabilities across various domains. With features like performance monitoring, request tracking, Yaquoti empowers businesses to streamline their processes, identify bottlenecks, and proactively address issues. The dashboard\u0026rsquo;s solutions span IT service management, employee management, and more, making it an indispensable tool for businesses seeking to optimize their operations and ensure a seamless and secure digital environment.\n","date":"11 Jun 2023","permalink":"/work/yaquoti-workflow/","section":"Work","summary":"Yaquoti Workflow is an all-inclusive software designed for managing help desk operations and asset management.

I wrote my first line of code back in 2013. At that time, I had no idea what UX design was until 2017 when I worked for a startup that created a streaming platform. A friend of mine handed me a book about UX design. It was poorly translated to Arabic from English, but that poorly translated book was the beginning of something I had never thought of.\nIn 2017, I enrolled in college to study Information Systems, however after a year, I couldn’t see the added value of college, so I dropped choosing to focus on my career and continue what I have started with the experience that already had built. As of now, I have accumulated over six years of experience in the field, held positions in reputable companies, and contributed to numerous diverse projects. These projects ranged from small-scale software developments to large-scale system implementations, providing me with a rich and varied skill set.\nYou can read more here in my CV.\nHere's where I spend most of my day.
